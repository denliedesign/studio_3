                We hope your family is doing well and survived the crazy Texas weather! We missed having our dancers in class Feb 15 - 20. Due to power outages and dangerous road conditions, the best option was to keep the studio closed, conserve energy and keep our dancers and families safe at home. We will not have the opportunity to make up a full week of classes but will be offering a “Student Appreciation Week” May 24 - 27. More details to come.

                Our Recital venue, The Eisemann in Richardson, is currently re-evaluating their Covid protocol after Governor Abbott’s announcement this past week. We are all working diligently on recital details to ensure the safest environment for our dancers and audience. We hope to have more details to share around March 20th. Thanks so much for your patience.
