            All student accounts are REQUIRED to have a credit or debit card (Visa, Mastercard or Discover) saved online for monthly tuition payments.  Your account will be charged the yearly membership fee and 1st month’s tuition before being officially enrolled in class.  Monthly tuition will be auto charged on the first of each month thereafter UNLESS you choose to pay by check, cash or a different credit card by the 25th of the prior month.  Checks from your bank should be scheduled to arrive by the 25th if that is your payment choice.  If your credit card expires or is compromised, it is your responsibility to update your card.
            <br><br>
            A 30-day written notice is required if it becomes necessary to drop a class. You may email the studio at (studiothree.dance@gmail.com) or deliver a note to the front desk.
