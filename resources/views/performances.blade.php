                <p>
                    For the past 23 years, Studio 3 Dance has provided dancers with an exciting performance experience through its end of the year Recital. The performance offers our dancers a chance to shine in front of family and friends and it is truly the highlight of the dance school year. The Recital offers our students a professionally directed performance that allows them the opportunity to present the results of their year’s hard work, dedication, and progress.
                    <br><br>
                    A big part of the dance training process includes learning through performance. The experience helps build self-esteem, self-assurance, and contributes to a sense of confidence. Although performance opportunities can help prepare some students for a possible career in dance, they also contribute to success in non-dance activities. That onstage experience can result in better in-school presentations and improved social skills. The rehearsal process helps develop retention skills, and by working with their classmates on a group performance, they learn the positive aspects of working as a team to create the best end result.  Recital commitment is the responsibility of both students and their parents.
                    <br><br>
                    Our goal is to make the recital an organized, exciting experience for everyone involved.

                <p>
                    The Recital Fee is the fee charged each dancer for participation in our Spring Recital.  The Recital Fee is a NON-REFUNDABLE fee confirming your commitment to be a part of our performance. The recital fee is due in January.  It is $85 for the first child in the family and $65 for each additional child in the same family.  This fee does not include tickets to the performance.
                    <br><br>
                    Recital Dates TBD
                    <br><br>
                    <em>We will have details on specific recital times for each individual class after our production meeting with the Eisemann in early March.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    The recital is not mandatory for any dancer, but more than 98% of our dancers in recital classes do make the choice to participate. If you'd like to opt your dancer out of recital, please print and fill out

                <strong>Costumes</strong>
                <p>
                    The staff at Studio 3 spends many hours selecting costumes for each class. They are always age-appropriate and of the highest quality possible.  Students will need one costume for each subject they train in. All classes participate in the recital except Stretch and Flex, Technique and Mommy & Me. Combo classes only perform one dance.  <u>Costume prices include tax, shipping and handling, as well as all accessories (tights, hats, gloves, etc.).</u>
                    <br><br>
                    In an effort to ensure that costumes are delivered in time for an organized distribution to our students before portrait day, rehearsals, and performances, costume orders are placed during our Thanksgiving break.  <u>Costume manufacturers do not accept cancellations or offer refunds; therefore Studio 3 Dance does not refund costume deposits or payments.</u>
                    <br><br>
                    Preschool & 30-minute Children’s Classes - $80.00 per costume
                    <br>Levels I-II -III Classes - $95.00 per costume
                    <br>Levels IV-VII and Pointe Classes - $105.00 per costume
                    <br><br>
                    Costumes will not be ordered until Costumes fees are paid in full.  December 15, 2020 is the final day for payments to be made for our bulk costume order.   Parents or guardians accept full responsibility for all expenses, including surcharges and postage for costumes that are paid for and ordered after the December 15 deadline. The additional fee for late orders is $25.00 per costume. Studio 3 Dance does not accept responsibility if costumes are not received in time for the Recital due to late payments and add on orders placed after this deadline.
                    <br><br>
                    Costumes are always age-appropriate and of the highest quality possible.

                <strong>Sizing</strong>
                <p>
                    Measuring for costumes is during October and early November during scheduled class times. Each child will be measured in order to determine his or her proper costume size(s). We always add 1-2 inches to allow for growth.  If you wish to check the costume size being ordered for your dancer, please check at the front desk in early December.
